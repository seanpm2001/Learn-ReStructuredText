Project language file 1
==============

For Seanpm2001/Learn-ReStructuredText
-----------------

I chose ReStructuredText as the first project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-ReStructuredText) as this project is about learning the ReStructuredText programming language, and showing my knowledge for the language. Its project language file should represent what language is being showcased and studied here.

This is an instance in which I am using ReStructuredText as a project language. If you want to do the same for your project, add this to your ``.gitattributes`` file

::

*.rst linguist-detectable=true
*.rst linguist-documentation=false

::

Advanced version:
-----------------

::

    # ReStructuredText (*.rst)
    *.rst linguist-detectable=true
    *.rst linguist-documentation=false

::
